# Project 1

Web Programming with Python and JavaScript

Hello!
Here is my project.
I used one application and one import file for my project. 

"Login" function checks user data then brings to search page.
"Search" function works as requested.
"Book_api" function. I converted SQL AVG and COUNT requests results into floats to make it work with Json.
Templates are:
-layout
-index, wich is login as well
-register
-search_results
-result
-book

Used "re" package to check email spelling for registration. Referenced to https://docs.python.org/3/library/re.html.
Login system works as "if" statements checking session variable in the beginning of main functions.

I hope you will find my project acceptable.
Thank you.
